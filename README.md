using a technique called "Transfer Learning"

Create the pre-trained model: 

Make all the layers in the pre-trained model non-trainable

Define a Callback class that stops training once accuracy reaches 99.9%

Pipelining the pre-trained model with your own

create_final_model :

Create the complete model by using the Model class
